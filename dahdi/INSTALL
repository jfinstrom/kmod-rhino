Quick and dirty install.
#########################
Extract the source for dahdi-linux and rhino-linux to
your /usr/src directory. Compile and install DAHDI first,
then the rhino-linux drivers. Optionally you may need to copy
the Module[s].symvers file generated in the dahdi-linux
sources (in the drivers/ directory) into the drivers/rhino
directory in case you get symbol errors on load. Compiling
the rhino-linux drivers is as simple as "make". Follow
any printed messages if there's an error. To install, 
a simple "make install" is all that's needed. 
That's it. From there, you can follow the DAHDI
configuration docs and processes.
