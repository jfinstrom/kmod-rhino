July 8, 2009		brycec 0.99.2
	Released. These drivers will ONLY work with DAHDI
	version 2.2.0 and above. For earlier versions, you
	must use version 0.99.1 of our drivers. There is no
	difference in functionality between these packages,
	only the DAHDI compatibility.

May 11, 2009		brycec 0.99.2-beta1
	Digium's DAHDI EC struct changed, so our drivers were
	modifed to remain compatible. Circa DAHDI ver. 2.2.0

December 01, 2008	brycec 0.99.1
	Removed the dummy Module.symvers file. While the build
	tested fine in the lab, real-world CentOS machines have
	their version checking on, making the modules look
	for version "0" of DAHDI symbols.
	Also please note, you can almost certainly safely ignore
	any warnings given during compilation. If there's an
	error, the build process will stop.
	As always, please report any bugs and issues to Rhino.

October 02, 2008	brycec	0.99
	Rhino's initial release of its DAHDI driver tree.
	These drivers should be considered BETA. We have tested
	them in our own lab, but they do not have real-world
	testing yet, due primarily to DAHDI's relative
	infancy.
	Please report any bugs and issues to Rhino.
