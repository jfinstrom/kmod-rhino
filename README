These are the source packages for the Rhino kernel modules.

This is *NOT* an official repo but is kept up to date by an official 
employee. Bugs changes and suggestions reported here will get upstream.

Feel free to submit pull request and bugs and I will pass all changes along.


There are two folders as there are two branches. 
Support for zaptel by it's maintainers has been deprecated so the zaptel
branch is typically bug fix only. The zaptel sources build the following:
r4fxo.ko
rcbfx.ko
r1t1.ko
rxt1.ko

Zaptel has been replaced by DAHDI. The maintainers of DAHDI are actively
developing DAHDI and making feature and API changes. A bulk of the changes
you will see will be on the DAHDI branch. 

The Dahdi sources will build the following:
rcbfx.ko
r1t1.ko
rxt1.ko

The module r4fxo.ko was depricated in the port to DAHDI. If you wish to port
it you are welcome to but it is no longer officialy maintained in the 
DAHDI tree.
